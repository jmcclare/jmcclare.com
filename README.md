This is the source code for my personal website,
[jmcclare.com](http://jmcclare.com).

This is an example of a site built with my Node.js [Koa 2 site
template](https://github.com/jmcclare/koa-template). It also uses my
[investment calculator React app](https://github.com/jmcclare/investment-calc).


## Versions ##

Aside from what is here in the appâ€™s local library directories (`node_modules`,
`site_modules`, `lib`), these are the versions of software dependencies this
site has been tested with.

* node: v10.0.0
* npm: 5.6.0
* npx: 9.7.1
* coffee: CoffeeScript version 2.2.2
